/**
 * Streaming-Aware Input Gate
 *
 * Demonstrates `event.streamingBehavior` to skip expensive pre-processing
 * during mid-stream steering, where low latency matters.
 *
 * This extension prepends `git diff --stat` output when the user mentions
 * file changes, giving the model immediate context. During steering the
 * exec call is skipped so the correction reaches the model without delay.
 *
 * Start brian with this extension:
 *   brian -e ./examples/extensions/input-transform-streaming.ts
